slaughter - Perl Automation Tool

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  General Options:

   --delay         Delay for up to N seconds prior to launching.   Useful if you have a lot of clients.
   --dump          Dump details of the local environment, and immediately exit.
   --mail          Email the output of any LogMessages to the given address.
   --no-delete     Don't delete the compiled perl post-execution.
   --no-execute    Don't actually execute the downloaded policy.
   --transports    Dump the names of all available transports.
   --include       Include the specified file in our wrapper content.

  File/Policy Fetching:

   --prefix         The prefix for the transport we're using.
   --transport      The transport to use for policy/file-fetching
   --username       The username for the policy-fetch, if appropriate (http-only).
   --password       The password for the policy-fetch, if appropriate (http-only).
   --transport-args Any arguments to pass to the transport (used for rsync/hg/git/svn).

  Help Options:

   --help        Show the help information for this script.
   --manual      Read the manual for this script.
   --verbose     Show useful debugging information.
   --version     Show the version number of the slaughter client.

=head1 ABOUT

slaughter is a simple system administration and server automation tool,
which is designed to download policy files from a central server and
execute them locally.

The policy files which are downloaded are perl scripts which are executed
with the help of a simple wrapper module - this module provides several new
language functions (or primitives) which can be useful to manage systems.

=cut


=head1 TRANSPORTS

When this tool is invoked it will attempt to fetch a file called
"policies/default.policy".  This policy may include others, which
are fetched in turn and inserted.

The policies, and any associated files, may be fetched via one of
several mechanisms:

=over 8

=item git

=item http

=item local

=item mercurial

=item rsync

=item subversion

=back

The simplest mechanism is HTTP, which can be configured by specifying the
prefix-URL of the server from which to download the files, and the transport of
'http'.

Given the configuration:

=for example begin

   --transport=http --prefix=http://server.example.org/slaughter/

=for example end

The client will download the file:

=for example begin

   http://server.example.org/slaughter/policies/default.policy

=for example end

The path "/policies/" is automatically appended to the first fetch,
and to all subsequent policies.  Similarly all files will be assumed
to be beneath the common URL-prefix of:

=for example begin

   http://server.example.org/slaughter/files/

=for example end

There are examples of other transports, including server-setup, in the
included file TRANSPORTS.

=cut


=head1 PRIMITIVES

There are several primitives and variables available to your code which are
made available by the various Slaughter modules.

These primitives and variables are described online:

=for example begin

  http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/slaughter/primitives/

  http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/slaughter/variables/

=for example end

=cut


=head1 DEBUGGING

The simplest way to debug a potential problem is to execute slaughter
with both the C<--no-delete> and C<--verbose> options.  This will ensure that
once the policy/policies are downloaded and compiled they will be kept.

The result should be that you'll be shown the name of a file - this file
may be executed interactively to see what is going on.

You may also invoke slaughter with the C<--dump> flag which will cause
it to display the environmental details it has discovered, and which will
be compiled into the policy prior to execution.

=cut


=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration of this tool may be carried out via the command line,
however some options may be more naturally supplied in the system-wide
configuration file.

For Unix platforms the global configuration file is located at
C</etc/slaughter/slaughter.conf>, and it may be found at C<C:/slaughter.conf>
for Microsoft Windows systems.

A fully-featured file might look something like this:

=for example begin

  #
  #  Comments start with "#"
  #

  #
  #  Be quiet
  ##
  verbose = 0

  #
  #  Sleep for up to 60 seconds prior to working.
  #
  #  This is useful if you have many clients all hitting the same
  # central server at the same time (due to NTP and hourly cron
  # scheduling for example).
  #
  delay = 60

  #
  # Fetch the default policy from http://example.com/slaughter/policies/default.policy
  #
  # NOTE: "policies/default.policy" is automatically appended.
  ##
  transport = http
  prefix    = http://example.com/slaughter/

=for example end
